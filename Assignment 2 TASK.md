Assignment 2 - Vibe Coding

Brief description: This assignment is mandatory and will be evaluated as part of your final grade. This assignment must be completed individually. Before attempting the assignment, you should study the module content.
In this activity, we will explore the emerging world of vibe coding introduced in the module. You will ask the computer to generate a mockup of a website homepage and then prompt it to write the HTML code needed to turn that design into a functioning webpage. Afterward, you will save the code into a file and view your webpage in a browser.
The rendered webpage may not look as visually impressive as the mockup, not because of GPT’s lack of programming ability, but simply because we do not have access to the high-quality image files used in the mockup. (Those live on the web and are not automatically downloaded onto your computer.)
Below you will find step-by-step instructions, along with a short how-to video by Dr. Abel Sanchez (linked at the end).
Note: Some computers may display a minor error when you try to view the HTML. This is usually caused by the computer saving your file as a .txt file rather than .html. Step 5 explains how to fix this in about one minute.
 
Instructions:
1. Generate a website mockup 
Use a prompt like: 
“Create an image of a mock web user interface for a Global Gen-AI Community. Make the user interface clean, elegant, and modern.” 
Feel free to adapt this to your interests, especially the underlined portions. You can request a homepage for accounting services, a business attorney, a consulting firm or anything else.  
Note: image generation may take longer than regular prompts (even up to a few minutes). If you do not like the first result, refine the prompt and try again. 

2. Generate the HTML code
Once you are happy with the mockup, enter the following prompt: 
“I now want to create an implementation of the user interface. Please create the HTML code.” 
The system will return the code that creates a functioning version of the website using standard web languages (HTML and sometimes CSS). In our example, the result was about 150 lines of code. 

3. Copy and save the code
Copy the HTML code into a basic text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac). Do not use Word or Google Docs as these apps add invisible formatting that will break the code.
Save the file as: 
index.html
This is the standard name for homepage files. 

4. Open the file in a browser
Place the index.html file into its own folder, then choose one of these two options:
a. Drag and drop the file into a web browser window (Chrome, Edge, etc.) and view the front page you have created. 
b. If this only shows you the HTML code as plain text instead of the actual website, continue to Step 5. 

5. Fix the file extension (if needed)
Sometimes your computer saves the file as index.html.txt, even though you only typed .html. This makes the browser treat the file as a text document, not a webpage.
Here is how to fix it:
a. Open the folder where the file is saved (not the file itself). b. At the top of the folder window, click “View.” c. Select “Show file name extensions.” 
d. Manually rename the file from index.html.txt to index.html. 
If you see a warning about changing the file type, click OK because this is what we want. 
e. Now drag and drop the file into your browser again. You should see the rendered webpage. 

6. Write up your results 
Write a short summary explaining your thoughts on the process and how your company could make use of vibe coding. Please include two images:
a. A mockup of your original idea  
b. The HTML webpage you created
